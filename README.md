LLD Design for Strategy Design Pattern


This pattern lets you group related algorithms. This way you can put each algorithm into a separate class (‘strategies’), and make their objects interchangeable without modifying the client. In this way, a class behavior or its algorithm can be changed at run time, depending on the strategy selected. 

if same behaviour of the method is shown in child classes of the base class then we implement a strategy to remove the duplicacy

LLD Design for Strategy Design Pattern


This pattern lets you group related algorithms. This way you can put each algorithm into a separate class (‘strategies’), and make their objects interchangeable without modifying the client. In this way, a class behavior or its algorithm can be changed at run time, depending on the strategy selected.
